# What is NLP(Natural Language Processing) ?  
  NLP (Natural Language Processing) is a subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and       generate human language. NLP involves the development of algorithms, statistical models, and machine learning techniques to process and analyze text and speech data.   
  
  NLP has a wide range of applications, including language translation, sentiment analysis, text summarization, speech recognition, and conversational agents. Some examples of NLP technologies in everyday use include virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, chatbots for customer support, and spam filters for email.  
  
  NLP techniques rely on a combination of linguistics, mathematics, and computer science. Key tasks in NLP include tokenization (splitting text into words or sentences), part-of-speech tagging (identifying the grammatical role of each word), named entity recognition (identifying names of people, places, and organizations), sentiment analysis (determining the emotional tone of text), and machine translation (converting text from one language to another).  
  
  The field of NLP is rapidly evolving, driven by advances in machine learning and deep learning techniques, as well as the increasing availability of large amounts of text and speech data.  




# What is Text Summarization?  
  Text Summarization is the process of distilling the most impornt information from a source text.  
# Why automatic text summarization?  
  1. Summarization reduce reding time.  
  2. When researching documents, summaries make the selection process easier.  
  3. Automatic summarization improves the effectiveness of indexing.  
  4. Automatic summarization algorithms are less biased than human summarizers.  
  5. Personalized summaries are useful in question-answring systems as the provide personalized     information.
